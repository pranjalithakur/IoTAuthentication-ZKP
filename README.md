# Authentication of IoT Devices Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

## Objective of the Project:
The primary aim of this project was to develop a novel authentication protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, utilizing the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). The focus was on creating a one-round MultiGraph Zero Knowledge Proof (M-ZKP) protocol to significantly enhance security by reducing overhead, eliminating impersonation risks, and offering faster, more secure authentication compared to traditional methods.

### Skills Learned:

Deep understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and their application in IoT device authentication.
Advanced skills in designing and optimizing cryptographic protocols.
